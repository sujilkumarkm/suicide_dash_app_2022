(2018), this study aimed to produce new insights that can help government bodies better grasp the problems that lie beneath them. This research could also benefit them in developing new strategies to minimize mortality rates over time. This research will look at a variety of suicide attributes and predict how many more fatalities will occur in various countries in the next years.'

Suicide, for example, is becoming a more prevalent and serious problem in India, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). To address these issues, we must examine various patterns and clusters in the data and determine what circumstances cause someone to consider suicide. In addition, a web-based system will be developed that may offer dynamically illuminating visualizations of the suicide dataset, as well as opportunities for page administrators to submit new suicides to the dataset.'
